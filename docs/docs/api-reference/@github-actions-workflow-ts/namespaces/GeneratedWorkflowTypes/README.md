## Type Aliases

| Type Alias | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Branch](type-aliases/Branch.md) | When using the push and pull_request events, you can configure a workflow to run on specific branches or tags. If you only define only tags or only branches, the workflow won't run for events affecting the undefined Git ref. The branches, branches-ignore, tags, and tags-ignore keywords accept glob patterns that use the * and ** wildcard characters to match more than one branch or tag name. For more information, see https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet. The patterns defined in branches and tags are evaluated against the Git ref's name. For example, defining the pattern mona/octocat in branches will match the refs/heads/mona/octocat Git ref. The pattern releases/** will match the refs/heads/releases/10 Git ref. You can use two types of filters to prevent a workflow from running on pushes and pull requests to tags and branches: - branches or branches-ignore - You cannot use both the branches and branches-ignore filters for the same event in a workflow. Use the branches filter when you need to filter branches for positive matches and exclude branches. Use the branches-ignore filter when you only need to exclude branch names. - tags or tags-ignore - You cannot use both the tags and tags-ignore filters for the same event in a workflow. Use the tags filter when you need to filter tags for positive matches and exclude tags. Use the tags-ignore filter when you only need to exclude tag names. You can exclude tags and branches using the ! character. The order that you define patterns matters. - A matching negative pattern (prefixed with !) after a positive match will exclude the Git ref. - A matching positive pattern after a negative match will include the Git ref again. |

| [Matrix](type-aliases/Matrix.md) | A build matrix is a set of different configurations of the virtual environment. For example you might run a job against more than one supported version of a language, operating system, or tool. Each configuration is a copy of the job that runs and reports a status. You can specify a matrix by supplying an array for the configuration options. For example, if the GitHub virtual environment supports Node.js versions 6, 8, and 10 you could specify an array of those versions in the matrix. When you define a matrix of operating systems, you must set the required runs-on keyword to the operating system of the current job, rather than hard-coding the operating system name. To access the operating system name, you can use the matrix.os context parameter to set runs-on. For more information, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions. |
| [MergeGroupEvent](type-aliases/MergeGroupEvent.md) | Runs your workflow when a pull request is added to a merge queue, which adds the pull request to a merge group.

| [Path](type-aliases/Path.md) | When using the push and pull_request events, you can configure a workflow to run when at least one file does not match paths-ignore or at least one modified file matches the configured paths. Path filters are not evaluated for pushes to tags. The paths-ignore and paths keywords accept glob patterns that use the * and ** wildcard characters to match more than one path name. For more information, see https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet. You can exclude paths using two types of filters. You cannot use both of these filters for the same event in a workflow. - paths-ignore - Use the paths-ignore filter when you only need to exclude path names. - paths - Use the paths filter when you need to filter paths for positive matches and exclude paths. |
| [Permissions](type-aliases/Permissions.md) | You can modify the default permissions granted to the GITHUB_TOKEN, adding or removing access as required, so that you only allow the minimum required access. |
| [PermissionsLevel](type-aliases/PermissionsLevel.md) | - |
| [ProjectCardEvent](type-aliases/ProjectCardEvent.md) | Runs your workflow anytime the project_card event occurs. More than one activity type triggers this event. For information about the REST API, see https://developer.github.com/v3/projects/cards. |

| [PullRequestEventTypes](type-aliases/PullRequestEventTypes.md) | Selects the types of activity that will trigger a workflow run. Most GitHub events are triggered by more than one type of activity. For example, the event for the release resource is triggered when a release is published, unpublished, created, edited, deleted, or prereleased. The types keyword enables you to narrow down activity that causes the workflow to run. When only one activity type triggers a webhook event, the types keyword is unnecessary. You can use an array of event types. For more information about each event and their activity types, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#webhook-events. |
| [PullRequestReviewCommentEvent](type-aliases/PullRequestReviewCommentEvent.md) | Runs your workflow anytime a comment on a pull request's unified diff is modified, which triggers the pull_request_review_comment event. More than one activity type triggers this event. For information about the REST API, see https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/comments. Note: Workflows do not run on private base repositories when you open a pull request from a forked repository. When you create a pull request from a forked repository to the base repository, GitHub sends the pull_request event to the base repository and no pull request events occur on the forked repository. Workflows don't run on forked repositories by default. You must enable GitHub Actions in the Actions tab of the forked repository. The permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN in forked repositories is read-only. For more information about the GITHUB_TOKEN, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions. |
| [PullRequestReviewEvent](type-aliases/PullRequestReviewEvent.md) | Runs your workflow anytime the pull_request_review event occurs. More than one activity type triggers this event. For information about the REST API, see https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/reviews. Note: Workflows do not run on private base repositories when you open a pull request from a forked repository. When you create a pull request from a forked repository to the base repository, GitHub sends the pull_request event to the base repository and no pull request events occur on the forked repository. Workflows don't run on forked repositories by default. You must enable GitHub Actions in the Actions tab of the forked repository. The permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN in forked repositories is read-only. For more information about the GITHUB_TOKEN, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions. |
| [PullRequestTargetEventTypes](type-aliases/PullRequestTargetEventTypes.md) | Selects the types of activity that will trigger a workflow run. Most GitHub events are triggered by more than one type of activity. For example, the event for the release resource is triggered when a release is published, unpublished, created, edited, deleted, or prereleased. The types keyword enables you to narrow down activity that causes the workflow to run. When only one activity type triggers a webhook event, the types keyword is unnecessary. You can use an array of event types. For more information about each event and their activity types, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#webhook-events. |
| [RegistryPackageEvent](type-aliases/RegistryPackageEvent.md) | Runs your workflow anytime a package is published or updated. For more information, see https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages. |
| [ReleaseEvent](type-aliases/ReleaseEvent.md) | Runs your workflow anytime the release event occurs. More than one activity type triggers this event. For information about the REST API, see https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/ in the GitHub Developer documentation. |
| [RepositoryDispatchEvent](type-aliases/RepositoryDispatchEvent.md) | You can use the GitHub API to trigger a webhook event called repository_dispatch when you want to trigger a workflow for activity that happens outside of GitHub. For more information, see https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create-a-repository-dispatch-event. To trigger the custom repository_dispatch webhook event, you must send a POST request to a GitHub API endpoint and provide an event_type name to describe the activity type. To trigger a workflow run, you must also configure your workflow to use the repository_dispatch event. |
| [Shell](type-aliases/Shell.md) | You can override the default shell settings in the runner's operating system using the shell keyword. You can use built-in shell keywords, or you can define a custom set of shell options. |
| [Snapshot](type-aliases/Snapshot.md) | You can use `jobs.<job_id>.snapshot` to generate a custom image. Add the snapshot keyword to the job, using either the string syntax or mapping syntax as shown in https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-runners/larger-runners/use-custom-images#generating-a-custom-image. Each job that includes the snapshot keyword creates a separate image. To generate only one image or image version, include all workflow steps in a single job. Each successful run of a job that includes the snapshot keyword creates a new version of that image. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-runners/larger-runners/use-custom-images. |
| [StatusEvent](type-aliases/StatusEvent.md) | Runs your workflow anytime the status of a Git commit changes, which triggers the status event. For information about the REST API, see https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/. |

| [WorkflowDispatchInput](type-aliases/WorkflowDispatchInput.md) | A string identifier to associate with the input. The value of <input_id> is a map of the input's metadata. The <input_id> must be a unique identifier within the inputs object. The <input_id> must start with a letter or _ and contain only alphanumeric characters, -, or _. |
| [WorkflowRunEvent](type-aliases/WorkflowRunEvent.md) | This event occurs when a workflow run is requested or completed, and allows you to execute a workflow based on the finished result of another workflow. For example, if your pull_request workflow generates build artifacts, you can create a new workflow that uses workflow_run to analyze the results and add a comment to the original pull request. |
| [WorkingDirectory](type-aliases/WorkingDirectory.md) | Using the working-directory keyword, you can specify the working directory of where to run the command. |
