# Type Alias: DeploymentStatusEvent

> **DeploymentStatusEvent** = \{\[`k`: `string`\]: `unknown`; \} \| `null`

Defined in: [types/githubActionsWorkflow.ts:84](https://github.com/emmanuelnk/github-actions-workflow-ts/blob/eb791f98a5c7871cf5c52fc4e1567bf9fe1afcd1/packages/lib/src/types/githubActionsWorkflow.ts#L84)

Runs your workflow anytime a third party provides a deployment status, which triggers the deployment_status event. Deployments created with a commit SHA may not have a Git ref. For information about the REST API, see https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/#create-a-deployment-status.
