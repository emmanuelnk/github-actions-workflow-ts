# Type Alias: RepositoryDispatchEvent

> **RepositoryDispatchEvent** = \{\[`k`: `string`\]: `unknown`; \} \| `null`

Defined in: [types/githubActionsWorkflow.ts:336](https://github.com/emmanuelnk/github-actions-workflow-ts/blob/eb791f98a5c7871cf5c52fc4e1567bf9fe1afcd1/packages/lib/src/types/githubActionsWorkflow.ts#L336)

You can use the GitHub API to trigger a webhook event called repository_dispatch when you want to trigger a workflow for activity that happens outside of GitHub. For more information, see https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create-a-repository-dispatch-event.
To trigger the custom repository_dispatch webhook event, you must send a POST request to a GitHub API endpoint and provide an event_type name to describe the activity type. To trigger a workflow run, you must also configure your workflow to use the repository_dispatch event.
